[%- IF devel.requires.Swim %]

Swim
----

The documentation for this project, such as the C-Cookbook, is written in the
Swim format. When working with `.swim` format files we recommend installing
the Swim CPAN module.

  perldoc Swim

gives you a detailed description of the Swim format.

To generate a preview of a Swim document, you can convert it to POD format
using the `swim` utility program, then view it with `perldoc`:

  swim --to=pod --wrap --complete file.swim > file.pod
  perldoc file.pod

The Zilla::Dist command `zild update` will update all the files in the repo
that use Swim.
