=head1 NAME

Zilla::Dist - HASH(0x2517e70)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    > zild setup
    > zild upgrade
    > # hack hack hack
    > make publish

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a formalization of a Perl module / package repository layout
and release process that I have been evolving for some time. I use the same
layout for Bash, Ruby, Python and Node.js package publishing.

A fully stacked top level might look like this:

    Changes         # History in YAML
    Meta            # Meta info for all needs (including dzil)
    Makefile        # Automation of test, dist, publish, etc
    ReadMe.pod      # Generated from `doc/Module.kwim`
    bin/            # Scripts
    doc/            # Kwim docs
    eg/             # Examples
    lib/            # Perl `.pm` code
    share/          # Shared files
    test/           # Test suite

Note a few things:

=over

=item * Sane / readable names

=item * Directories are lowercase / never plural

=item * Files are TitleCase

=item * No file extensions (if possible)

=item * No extra meta files like C<dist.ini>, C<.travis.yml>, C<bower.json> etc

These are the I<bost of> from all the package systems I've used. They make me
happy, and not tied to legacy bad ideas.

The Makefile has these targets:

=over

=item C<make test>

Use C<prove -lv test>

=item C<make install>

Do a C<dzil> install.

=item C<make doc>

Make the C<ReadMe.pod> and other stuff.

=item Turn repo into a `Dist

ZillaC< ready subdirectory called >.I<cpan>`. This

C<make cpan>
directory has a C<dist.ini> file.

=item C<make dist>

Basically the same as C<make cpan; cd cpan; dzil build>.

=item C<make distdir>

Unzip the dist, for inspection.

=item C<make publish>

Have C<dzil> build a dist, then C<cpan-upload> it.

=item C<make publish-dryrun>

Yep.

=item Upgrade the [Zilla

Dist] packaging files. (Makefile etc)

C<make upgrade>

=head1 RATIONALE RANTING

I've published a lot of I<packages> in a lot of programming languages. I like
taking the best ideas and spreading them around. I like reusing ideas and code
and tools as much as possible between these packages.

I trust dzil to DTRT with regard to the CPAN release process. I use almost the
exact same C<dist.ini> for some 20 CPAN packages that I've converted to date.

I don't like cluttered repos and adding new I<metadata> files for each new
tool that needs one. The C<dist.ini> file is not bad, but I can generate it
from metadata easily. So I did.

As much as I differ from the norm here, I want my CPAN publishings to be
normal to normal mongers (if there's such a thing). The C<make publish>
process does just that. End users would have to look hard to know this wasn't
a "normal" dzil release.

I'm packaging this packaging process as L<Zilla::Dist> for others to use. It's
also a decent example of a CPAN package packaged with itself.

=head1 NOTES

Some of the tools in here are Bash, some are Perl. I'm doing a lot in the area
of Bash Package packaging. See L<http://bpan.org>.

I use the term C<Package> where CPAN people have used the term
C<Distribution>. Perl is the only language (in my packaging experience
to do so).

The name C<t/> is another outlier. The most common is C<test> followed
by C<tests>.

I don't like plural directory names. Try singular. I think you'll like it too.

ALLCAPSFILENAMES ARE TOO LOUD! ChillOut.
